# Github Battle
## [LIVE DEMO](https://github-battle-a5f22.firebaseapp.com/)

A single-page application showcasing my knowledge of React, React Router, Webpack, ES6, and the Github API. Built while studying the most recent release of the React Training ['React Fundamentals'](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) program - the most up to date (v15.5) React course currently available. Enter two Github usernames and battle them against one another, or click on the 'popular' link in the nav bar to see the most popular repos currently on Github for your chosen language.
